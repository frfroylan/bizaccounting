- Trouble figuring out a way to make the title move with the content but not have the same padding on top. Solution is going to be to remove the padding from content and use another class that they share so that they both move with the navigation menu. It worked but it caused some weird padding on the content, now instead of using padding: 100px (height of toggle nav button) it is now 31px.
